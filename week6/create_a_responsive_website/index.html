            <img class="equipImg" src="images\XJS500.jpg ">

            <p>The <b>XJS500</b> is an upgrade to the previous <b>XKS300</b> model, featuring a new resistance-band system that users will find easy to use. Designed for both serious fitness buffs and beginners, the <b>XJS500</b> provides easy setup and
                storage with built-in holsters for extra bands and bars. While still allowing for users to work out with light weights or their own body weight, the <b>XJS500</b> is designed for all users at any stage of their fitness needs. The esistance
                bands range from 5 lb. to 25 lb. Additional bands can be purchased as necessary. The <b>XJS500</b> is safe and easy to use and can be used alone or with a partner. The locking points prevent the bar from moving outside the normal range
                of motion. Since there are no heavy plates, you don't have to worry about dropping anything that could damage your floor. The resistance bands are made of sturdy, hard rubber rated for the resistance marked on each side.</p><br>
            <p>The <b>XJS500</b> can be configured to perform a number of different exercises. The detached bench is adjustable for both incline and decline workouts, with detachable leg- and bicep-curl attachments. The basic package includes resistance
                bands for workouts of up to 200 lb. Additional bands can be purchased separately. All accessories are easy to install or store, allowing you to change your workout routine as often as you like. The basic package comes with a straight bar,
                ricep rope, bicep curl bar, ankle strap, and triangle bar. Additional accessories sold separately <i>include:</i> lat/row bar, curved bar, rams horns bar, and various tricep pull-down bars.</p><br>
            <p>The <b>XJS500</b> storage makes it easy to store all accessories and bands in one place for easy access. This makes the <b>XJS500</b> an excellent choice for people who want a quality home gym while avoiding paying for a professional gym membership.</p>
